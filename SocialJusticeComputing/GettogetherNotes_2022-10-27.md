# Project Notes (2022-10-27)

## About

This project's goal is to highlight the complexity and expense needed to fix
all the crumbling infrastructure. Rather than celebrate the recent
Infrastructure bill as a success, Dr. Hubbard aims to drive the narrative in a
more realistic direction. $500bn is not enough compared to the sheer scope of
what needs to be fixed in our nation.
